# ETH-PROOF-Beginner-EVM-Course-Project

In this project, I am going to show you how a basic Ethereum-based token can be created using Solidity. This covers token minting and burning, but more importantly highlights major concepts in writing smart contracts such as mappings, public variables, conditionals, etc.

# Description
This project is meant to teach beginners the basics of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) course. To help foster some real hands-on learning, we will be building out a token smart contract with standard features, including:

- Minting tokens along with specific addresses
- Burning tokens from an address, but checks have to be in place to prevent overdrafts.
- Public stored variables of the token (name, symbol, and total supply).
- This contract serves as a basic example of how tokens work on the Ethereum blockchain and can be used as a foundation for more complex token designs.

# Getting Started
# Installing
Use Remix IDE or any Solidity-compatible environment.
The provided Solidity contract is all you need to deploy (no additional files or modifications required).
# Executing Program
1. Open the project in your Remix IDE or any Solidity environment.
2. Use Solidity version 0.8.18 or higher to compile the contract.
3. Deploy the contract to a local testnet or the real Ethereum Network.
4. Use the Remix interface to interact with the contract:
5. Use the mint function to mint tokens for an address.
6. Use the burn function to burn tokens from an address.
